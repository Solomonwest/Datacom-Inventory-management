# DATACOM TEAM DEVELOPMENT BREAKDOWN

# West Ngo Solomon BHU/24/04/05/0052
I worked on the front-end display of the project as well as managing the mysql db, Creating tables for drinks, beverages and utensils.
I also worked on the home route that displays the index page.

# AJAYI DANIEL TOLUWALASE BHU/24/04/10/0001
I worked on the insert function/route for both drinks inventory and beverages as well as the default route loading the landing page. I also added a funtionality that checks if the name of an item is already existing before proceeding to create that item.

# UZOR SAMUEL EBUBECHUKWU BHU/24/04/10/0029
I created the edit/update funtion for all tables that renders a template that carries the existing data of the ID that's been selected and then makes changes when a new correction has been made to the data. 

# OCHAI MARY ENTOSE BHU/24/04/09/0066 
I created the delete funtion that takes the ID based on the the row selected and therefore deletes the data from the DB.
I also created the sell route that renders a template " UNDER MAINTANANCE "

# SERIKI ISRAEL ADAVUDI BHU/24/04/05/0059
I worked on the Insert fuction for the utensills table. I also styled all the edit templates, giving then a unique and interesting design.
